## The purpose of this design was to try to incorporate bright and exciting moods into muted and minimalist designs with plenty of empty space

##this calls attention to each of the areas being focused at a particular time, because while the static design works, it does not draw attention

##Because gradients are not capable of using transition times, this was accomplished by using the ::before pseudoclass to create a transparent copy of the other gradient, and fading them with opacity
